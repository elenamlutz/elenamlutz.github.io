      <h2 class="subhead">State inspectors issue civil penalties against nursing homes out-of-compliance with Medicare, endangering the health and safety of their vulnerable residents. But how are fines being issued?</h2>

      <p class="body-text serif">Texas is the second worst nation to grow old in, and has the worst ranking in the country when it comes to staffing. Poor staffing is a trend across the state, and harm of residents due to negligence can happen anywhere, no matter the facility’s record or location.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">State inspectors from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission inspect each of the state's nursing homes receving money from Medicare. They also conduct investigations when complaints are filed and send their findings of their surveys to Medicare. But when it comes to fines issued against nursing homes posing a health and safety risk to vulnerable elderly citizens, the system starts to get questionable.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Texas has the largest number of nursing homes, yet the average recommended federal fine per nursing home fares close to the middle compared to other states –– even with the worst staffing rating in the country. I downloaded a databases listing all penalties issued by Medicare in Texas since 2014 and all the inspection reports conducted. I found that most fines aren't greater than $200,000, and that fines are highly dependent on the deficiency that the nursing home is being cited for. </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">But I also found some inspection reports where surveyors investigated deaths due to negligence of the facility, marked with red dots below, and the possibly preventable death of a resident isn't usually as massively fined as other instances.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">How are complaints fined?</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">When state inspectors visit a facility, they either do it because its mandated by Medicare or because a complaint was filed against the facility. I analyzed the top 10 facilities with most complaints filed against them and with most fines issued by Medicare. There is no correlation between the two. This could mean that large fines are mostly dependent on surprise visits conducted by inspectors as opposed to investigating complaints. Facilities are usually allotted a time period where they can correct their deficiency, so this suggests that they may have enough time to step into compliance after posing a threat to a resident whose family filed a complaint.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">But even surprise visits may not be enough. Under Texas law, facilities are given up to 45 days to fix any issues of non-compliance before administering penalties unless the deficiency is “immediate jeopardy” (J, K or L). Some graphic, unsanitary reports are sometimes not listed as “immediate jeopardy”, giving nursing homes some leniency to correct something without any repercussion. </p>

    <div class="story-body">
        <p class="body-text serif">The largest number facilities with more than 25 deficiencies are clustered in the biggest cities in Texas. But San Antonio stands out more than the rest –– five of the 20 facilities that are most out-of-compliances are located in San Antonio, which leads in Texas with 2,119 cited deficiencies since 2016.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">But a number of facilities with a lot of deficiencies are found in the Texas-Mexico border. Some of the top 20 facilities are found in McAllen, Brownsville, Laredo and Harlingen, cities that are far away from specialized health care facilities and hospitals located in more urbanized areas.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">NPR did a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/03/15/702645465/trump-administration-cuts-the-size-of-fines-for-health-violations-in-nursing-hom">story</a> on the Trump administration’s decision to alter the way it punishes nursing homes. Starting in the second quarter of 2017, officials were more often assessing one-time “per instance” fines, while the Obama administration relied more heavily on fines that were calculated based on the number of days the home was out of compliance. Those “per day” fines tend to be bigger because they compound, NPR reported.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Critics said that giving nursing homes less incentive to fix faulty and dangerous practices before someone gets hurt. When I did an analysis to calculate the total of fines issued against nursing homes per quarter, we can identify how numbers started to decrease again after Trump's rollback of Obama era policies and regulations of the nursing home industry.</p>
