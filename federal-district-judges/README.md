# How presidents build their legacy using the federal judiciary

Back in March, [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/10/trump-legacy-conservative-judges-district-courts) reported that President Donald Trump has built a legacy of 89 new confirmed federal judges, far in excess of appointments under Obama and Bush. From district courts to appellate courts to the Supreme Court, these judges are appointed for life -- even after Trump leaves the White House, federal judges will continue serving for decades. "Put together they form a kind of conservative judicial revolution that could impact all aspects of American life," The Guardian reported. Although judges don't openly have ideological leanings, the president who appoints them can give us a clue of their liberal or conservative interpretations of the constitution. 

I scraped the Federal Judiciary [website](https://www.fjc.gov/history/courts/u.s.-district-courts-and-federal-judiciary) using BeautifulSoup to extract and create a database of all district court judges in each state of the U.S., presidents who appointed them and their political party. Using Python, I cleaned the entire database to make sure it would include only judges that are still serving, and created an interactive map with Mapbox to show the political makeup of each jurisdiction.

Tools used: Python (pandas, regular expressions, BeautifulSoup), HTML, CSS, Mapbox.
